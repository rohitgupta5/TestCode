Overview
This is part 1 of Coursera Statistical Inference course project. In this simulation exercise, the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials with a thousand simulations is investigated and the exponential distribution in R is compared with the Central Limit Theorem. With this simulation, the following things are shown:

the sample mean and the theoretical mean
the sample variance and the theoretical variance
the distribution
