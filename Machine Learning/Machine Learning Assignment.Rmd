### OVERVIEW :: 
The objective and goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they performed the exercise and machine learning classification of accelerometers data on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise.  In training data ???classe??? is the outcome variable in the training set using predictor variables to predict 20 different test cases.The data for this project come from this source is: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ??? a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Exploratory Analysis ::

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
set.seed(301)
```

# Data Loading

 The training dataset is then partinioned in 2 to create a Training set (70% of the data) for the modeling process and a Test set (with the remaining 30%) for the validations. The testing dataset is not changed and will only be used for the quiz results generation.

```{r }
TrainUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
TestUrl  <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
TrainFile<-"pml-traininig.csv"
TestFile<-"pml-testing.csv"

# download the datasets
if(!file.exists(TrainFile))
{
    download.file(TrainUrl,destfile = TrainFile)
}
training <- read.csv(TrainFile)
if(!file.exists(TestFile))
{
    download.file(TestUrl,destfile = TestFile)
}
testing  <- read.csv(TestFile)

# create a partition using caret with the training dataset on 70,30 ratio
inTrain  <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

TrainSet <- training[inTrain, ]

TestSet  <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(TrainSet)

dim(TestSet)

```
Clean Non Zero Variable.

```{r }
NZV <- nearZeroVar(TrainSet)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -NZV]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -NZV]
dim(TestSet)

dim(TrainSet)

# remove variables that are mostly NA
AllNA    <- sapply(TrainSet, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, AllNA==FALSE]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, AllNA==FALSE]
dim(TestSet)

dim(TrainSet)

# remove identification only variables (columns 1 to 5)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -(1:5)]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -(1:5)]
dim(TrainSet)

```

## Rectification Analysis -
```{r }
corMatrix <- cor(TrainSet[, -54])
corrplot(corMatrix, order = "FPC", method = "color", type = "lower", 
         tl.cex = 0.8, tl.col = rgb(0, 0, 0))
```

## Prediction Model

Prediction model is described based on the below methods.
The methods are: Random Forests, Decision Tree and Generalized Boosted Model, as described below.

# Random Forest
```{r }

set.seed(301) 
controlRF <- trainControl(method="cv", number=3, verboseIter=FALSE)
modFitRandForest <- train(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method="rf",
                          trControl=controlRF)
modFitRandForest$finalModel

# prediction on Test dataset
predictRandForest <- predict(modFitRandForest, newdata=TestSet)
confMatRandForest <- confusionMatrix(predictRandForest, TestSet$classe)
confMatRandForest

# plot matrix results
plot(confMatRandForest$table, col = confMatRandForest$byClass, 
     main = paste("Random Forest - Accuracy =",
                  round(confMatRandForest$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```
